# Networking Fundamentals

An introductory overview of fundamental networking concepts, explaining how data is transmitted, addressed, and routed within computer networks.

## What is a Network?
Networks are connections between entities, found in many aspects of life, e.g., friend circles or family relationships.

In computing, however, a network is the connection of technological devices that allows them to share and exchange information, data and resources.

## Types of Networks

Computer networks are categorized based on their size, scope, and intended use, and each type supports communication and resource sharing in various environments.

**1. Personal Area Network `PAN`:** A small network for connecting devices around a single person, typically within a few meters.
> Example: Connecting a smartphone to a Bluetooth headset.


**2. Local Area Network `LAN`:** A network covering a small area like a home, office, or building, allowing devices to share resources.
  - A Wireless Local Area Network `WLAN` is a type of LAN that uses wireless connections (Wi-Fi) instead of cables.
> Example: Computers in an office connected to the same router `LAN` or accessing the office Wi-Fi `WLAN`.

**3. Campus Area Network `CAN`:** A network that connects multiple LANs within a limited area like a university or corporate campus.
> Example: Network connecting all departments in a university campus.

**4. Metropolitan Area Network `MAN`:** A network that spans a city or town, connecting multiple LANs.
> Example: Network linking branch offices of a city-based bank.

**5. Wide Area Network `WAN`:** A large network that spans cities, countries, or even globally, often using leased telecommunication lines.
> Example: The internet connecting users worldwide.

## Types of Network Topologies

Network topology refers to the physical or logical arrangement of devices (nodes) and connections (links) in a network. The common types include:

**1. Bus Topology:** All devices share a single communication line.
> Example: Old Ethernet networks using a coaxial cable.

**2. Star Topology:** All devices connect to a central hub or switch.
> Example: Modern office `LANs` with a central switch.

**3. Ring Topology:** Devices are connected in a circular manner, data travels in one or both directions.
> Example: Token Ring networks in some legacy systems.

**4. Mesh Topology:** Every device is connected to every other device.
> Example: Some WAN backbone networks for reliability.

**5. Tree Topology:** Hierarchical arrangement of star networks connected together.
> Example: University networks connecting departments and buildings.

**6. Hybrid Topology:** Combination of two or more topologies.
> Example: Large corporate networks combining star and mesh layouts.
