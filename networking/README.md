# Networking Notes

This folder contains my notes on networking concepts relevant to IT support and cybersecurity, especially for a SOC Analyst path.

The focus here is on understanding how data moves across networks, how systems communicate, and how network activity relates to security events and attacks.

Topics documented here are based on what I study from courses, labs, and books, written in my own words as my understanding improves.
