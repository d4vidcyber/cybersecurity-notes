# Layer 1: Physical Link

## Introduction

OSI Layer 1, known as the Physical Layer, is the lowest layer of the OSI model. It provides the foundation for network communication by defining how raw binary data (1s and 0s) is physically transmitted between devices. Without this layer, no higher-layer communication is possible

## Role of the Physical Layer in the OSI Model

The Physical Layer’s role is to move bits from one device to another across a physical medium. It does not interpret data, manage communication sessions, or handle addressing. Instead, it ensures that a physical connection exists and that bits can be reliably transmitted over it.

**Primary functions:**

  - Establishing and terminating physical connections

  - Defining electrical, optical, and radio characteristics

  - Ensuring synchronization between sender and receiver

## Bit Transmission and Signaling

At Layer 1, data is transmitted as signals that represent binary digits.

**Signaling types:**

  - Electrical signals (voltage changes in copper cables)

  - Optical signals (light pulses in fiber optics)

  - Wireless signals (radio waves in Wi-Fi and cellular networks)

**Key concepts of Signalling:**

  - Bits: Only 0s and 1s are handled

  - Signal strength and timing affect transmission quality

  - Noise and attenuation can distort signals

> Layer 1 defines how a bit is represented, not what the bit means.
