# Layer 2: Data Link

The Data Link Layer is responsible for reliable communication between devices on the same local network. It takes raw bits from the Physical Layer and organizes them into frames, using MAC addresses to identify source and destination devices.

Layer 2 also controls how devices access the network medium and detects transmission errors. Its local, trust-based operation makes it critical for both network performance and internal network security.
