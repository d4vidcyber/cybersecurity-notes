# Layer 3: Network

The Network Layer is responsible for moving data across different networks. Unlike Layer 2, which handles local delivery, Layer 3 enables end-to-end communication between devices on separate networks by using logical addressing and routing.

> It decides where data should go next, not how it is physically transmitted.

## Role and Purpose of Layer 3

The primary role of Layer 3 is to ensure successful delivery of data from source to destination across multiple networks.
