# Layer 4 - Transport

The Transport Layer is responsible for end-to-end communication between applications on different devices.
While Layer 3 ensures packets reach the correct device, Layer 4 ensures data reaches the correct application process.

**Role and Purposes**

Layer 4 provides:

  - Process-to-process delivery
  - Segmentation and reassembly
  - Port addressing
  - Flow control
  - Error control
  - Connection management

> It ensures data is delivered reliably or efficiently, depending on the protocol used.
