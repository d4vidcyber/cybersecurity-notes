# Linux Notes

This folder documents my learning of Linux fundamentals and command-line usage from a cybersecurity perspective.

The goal is to understand how Linux systems work, how to navigate and manage them, and how they are used in servers, security tools, and SOC environments.

Notes here reflect my personal learning progress and will grow as I gain more hands-on experience.
